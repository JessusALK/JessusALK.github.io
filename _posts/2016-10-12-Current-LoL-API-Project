I am currently working on a project that involves the Riot API. 
It manages information from the API and tracks stats for a player's performance on certain champions. 
It is being written in Java and uses a wrapper called Orianna. 
This project was inspired by my love for League of Legends and the desire to learn JavaFX and it has been a very fun project so far. 
Its also the first time I've worked with an API like the Riot API and learning how to manipulate the data that I can retrieve and forming a client that gathers information based on the player has been amazing. I hope to have it finished by the Summer of 2017.
